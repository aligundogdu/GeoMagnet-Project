# GeoMagnet Project 🧭🗺️🧲
**Every trip leaves a memory — every map holds a story.**

This project was born from a weekly tradition I share with my son: visiting ancient cities and historical sites while enjoying nature hikes. After each adventure, I mark the place on [map2stl.com](https://www.map2stl.com/), export a 3D terrain slice (STL), and print it using a 3D printer.

But that’s not all.

I also designed a custom 3D magnet frame, into which we place each printed map slice — turning every visit into a physical keepsake.

## ✨ Why This Exists

In an age of digital photos and fleeting stories, we wanted something tactile.  
Something we could **touch**, **collect**, and **remember**.  
This project combines:
- Family bonding through exploration
- Creativity through 3D design
- A personal archive of places we’ve truly experienced

And now, we're sharing it with the world.

## 🔧 What's in This Repo?

- `frame.stl`: The 3D-printable magnet frame designed to hold your terrain model
- Example terrain `.stl` files: Real samples from our trips
- Template files and tips for using [map2stl.com](https://www.map2stl.com/)
- Step-by-step guides for printing and customizing your magnets

---

## 🧲 How It Works

1. Go to [map2stl.com](https://www.map2stl.com/) and select your visited area
2. Export the STL model of the terrain
3. Print the model and the `frame.stl`
4. Insert the map slice into the frame
5. Attach a magnet and display it proudly!

## ⚙️ Recommended ma2stl Settings

When generating terrain models with [ma2stl](https://ma2stl.netlify.app/), we use the following settings:

- **Box Scale (Sampling Rate):** `2`
- **Model Scale:** `2.00`
- **Vertical Scale Factor:** `2.0`
- **Base Height:** `3 mm`
- **Water Drop:** `0 mm`

> Note: Coordinates change per location, but these settings remain consistent to ensure uniformity across all magnets.

## 🧱 Materials & Printing Tips

To build your own GeoMagnet, you'll need:

- **3D printer** (FDM with PLA/ABS recommended)
- **Print bed size:** 150x150mm or larger
- **Magnets:**
    - We use **5mm x 1mm neodymium magnets**
    - Example (Turkey): [Amazon TR – Magnet Set](https://www.amazon.com.tr/gp/product/B0BHSLGWDK?smid=A2WWZK4XHM25LW&psc=1)
    - If you're outside Turkey, **any 5mm diameter x 1mm thick neodymium magnet** should work
- **Glue (optional)** to fix magnets securely

> The frame's magnet slot has a slight tolerance for a snug press-fit.
